📘 MERN Testing & Debugging – Project README
📌 Overview

This project is a MERN stack application (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) configured to demonstrate:

Unit testing (React + Jest + Testing Library)

Integration testing (Node/Express + Supertest)

End-to-end testing (Cypress)

Debugging techniques (client + server)

CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions

Code coverage reporting (Jest)

The repository contains a full scaffolding for both client and server environments.

🚀 Getting Started
✅ 1. Clone the Project
🟦 CLIENT SETUP (React)
2. Install Dependencies
cd client
npm install
3. Start the React App
npm run dev
React will start at:
http://localhost:5173
🟥 SERVER SETUP (Node + Express)
4. Install Dependencies
cd server
npm install
5. Start the Backend Server
npm run dev
Default server runs on:
http://localhost:5000

🧪 Running Tests
🌐 1. Client Tests (React + Jest)

Inside the client/ folder:

Run all tests:
npm test

Run coverage:
npm run coverage

Coverage report becomes available in:
client/coverage/

🟥 2. Server Tests (Node + Jest + Supertest)

Inside the server/ folder:

Run tests:
npm test

Run coverage:
npm run coverage

Coverage report appears in:
server/coverage/

🧪 3. E2E Tests (Cypress)

Inside the client/ folder:

Open Cypress GUI:
npx cypress open

Run Cypress tests headless:
npx cypress run

🧰 Debugging Techniques Used

This project includes built-in debugging tools for both client and server.

🟦 Client Debugging (React)
1️⃣ Error Boundaries

The project includes an ErrorBoundary.jsx component:

Captures UI crashes

Displays fallback UI

Helps identify component-level errors

2️⃣ Console Debugging

React DevTools + browser console logs are used in development mode for tracing props, state, and API calls.

🟥 Server Debugging (Node.js/Express)
1️⃣ Global Error Handler

errorHandler.js captures:

Uncaught exceptions

Controller errors

Mongoose errors

It returns consistent JSON error responses.

2️⃣ Logging Middleware

Request logs show:

Methods

Routes

Request bodies

Error stack traces

3️⃣ Debugging with VSCode

Using built-in Node debugging:
"scripts": {
  "debug": "nodemon --inspect server.js"
}

🧪 Testing Approach & Coverage Explanation

This project uses a layered testing strategy common in production MERN apps:

1️⃣ Unit Tests

Used for:

Individual React components

Utility functions

Pure logic (helpers, formatters)

Tools:

Jest

React Testing Library (RTL)

Examples:

Button.test.jsx

App.test.jsx

2️⃣ Integration Tests

Used in the backend to verify:

Express route behavior

Controller logic

Database interaction

Authentication middleware

Tools:

Jest

Supertest

Example:

posts.test.js

3️⃣ End-to-End Tests

Simulate real user flows such as:

Viewing posts

Navigating pages

Form interactions

Tools:

Cypress

Example:

posts.cy.js

📊 Understanding Coverage

Running coverage creates reports like:

client/coverage/index.html

server/coverage/index.html

Coverage includes:

✔ Statements

Measures how many total lines of logic were executed.

✔ Branches

Checks conditional paths like:
if (...) { ... } else { ... }

✔ Functions

Ensures each function was called.

✔ Lines

Counts actual executed lines.

This project targets:

≥80% coverage for React components

≥70% backend coverage

Can be expanded as needed

⚙️ CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

A workflow file is included:
.github/workflows/ci.yml
It automatically:

Installs dependencies

Runs client + server tests

Generates coverage reports

Uploads coverage as artifacts
